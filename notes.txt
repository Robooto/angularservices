Angular servers you don't need to inject but you can.

Angular injects the word provider when you create provider type services.


Angular services are called with the new operator

$q is like jquery deferred;

$resource service abstraction layer above $http

works well with rest-ful services
returns resources with commonly used server methods already implemented
